				<br><br>
			<!-- <center><strong>Megan's Story: Donating blood in the memory of her grandfather</strong></center> -->
In late 2016, Megan Fernandez’s grandfather was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a cancer that originates in bone marrow, where blood cells are made. In the process of battling cancer and receiving treatment, it was necessary that her grandfather receive blood transfusions every week.
<br>
While the diagnosis was predictably difficult for her entire family, Megan expressed that the experience was also eye-opening. “You never think it’s going to be you or someone you know. But at any point, an accident can happen or some other medical complication. I never really processed just how many people rely on blood so consistently, like my grandfather did,” she said.
<br>
“I remember wishing we had the same blood type so that I could do something really tangible to help his treatment,” Megan said. And while Megan wasn’t able to donate directly to her grandfather, she was really thankful to those who did donate and generously and unknowingly supported him during his treatment and provided the family hope.
<br>
Sadly, Megan’s grandfather passed away within a year of his diagnosis. However, she continues to honor his memory in many ways — including blood donation. “While I started donating before he passed away, it has really become more important to me now. There are so many health issues that we don’t have solutions for, but it’s nice to be able to do something tangible to help while researchers continue to look for better methods of prevention and treatment,” she said.

				<br><br>
At just 19 years old, Julie Cruzal’s world was shaken when, for the first time that she could remember, it was her own hero — her mom — who needed saving.

On that fateful day, Julie witnessed the terrifying consequences of a medical condition her mom was experiencing that impacted her blood supply, unbeknownst to her family at the time. By the time her mom was rushed to the hospital, she had lost nearly 50% of her total blood volume and needed an emergency transfusion.

“It was really a wakeup call,” Julie said, “to see my mom, the person I looked up to and who never wavered in strength, to be so helpless in such a precarious position. It was a matter of life and death, and it really hit home that people can die from blood loss.”

Thanks to #Donate Blood team and generous blood donors, Julie’s mom made a full recovery. However, things never fully returned to how they had been before: After that day at the hospital, a “switch went off” for Julie, and she felt like she absolutely had to donate blood whenever she was able.

Julie became and has continued to be a regular blood donor throughout adulthood, and though she is tremendously grateful for the blood her mom received, she doesn’t view her own donations as anything spectacular. “I don’t see it as anything out of the ordinary or special; It’s something that has to be done,” she said. “All it is is a little bit of blood, so why wouldn’t I — why wouldn’t you — why wouldn’t we all be doing this?” she said.
